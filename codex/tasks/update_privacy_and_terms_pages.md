## 📄 Task Title
update_privacy_and_terms_pages.md

---

## 🎯 Goal
Create basic static pages under `/privacy` and `/terms` that render legal copy (Privacy Policy and Terms of Service) for the rightNOW app.
Ensure:
- Pages use the Shell layout and are styled minimally
- Copy content is updated from HelpMeAI → rightNOW
- No navigation logic is required unless specified later

---

## 🧠 Prompt to Codex
```
Create two new pages:

### 1. /privacy (web/app/privacy/page.tsx)
- Use Shell layout
- Page title: "Privacy Policy"
- Render static content (see below)
- Use `<div className="prose max-w-3xl mx-auto p-6">` wrapper for readability

### 2. /terms (web/app/terms/page.tsx)
- Use Shell layout
- Page title: "Terms of Service"
- Same styling wrapper as above

### Content:
Replace any occurrence of "HelpMeAI" with "rightNOW"
Replace contact email with: contactus@rgtnow.com
Keep links to Google OAuth permission page intact

### Optional UI:
- No sidebar nav links needed unless otherwise requested
- Optionally add a `<h1>` heading per page with `text-2xl font-bold`
- No need for back button unless requested
